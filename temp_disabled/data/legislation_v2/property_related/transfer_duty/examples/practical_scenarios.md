- $83,001-$319,000: $236,000 × 3.50% = $8,260
- $319,001-$600,000: $281,000 × 4.50% = $12,645

- Term remaining: 5 years
- Premium paid: $50,000

### Calculation
**Duty on lease assignment:**
- Annual rent: $150,000
- Up to $100,000: $100,000 × 2% = $2,000
- Excess $50,000: $50,000 × 4% = $2,000
- **Lease duty: $4,000**

**Duty on premium:**
