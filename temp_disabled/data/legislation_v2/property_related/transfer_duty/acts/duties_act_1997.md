## Calculation Methods

### Standard Residential Property
```
Example: Property value $500,000
- First $14,000: $14,000 × 1.25% = $175
- Next $18,000 ($32,000 - $14,000): $18,000 × 1.50% = $270
- Next $51,000 ($83,000 - $32,000): $51,000 × 1.75% = $892.50
- Remaining $417,000 ($500,000 - $83,000): $417,000 × 3.50% = $14,595
- Total Duty: $175 + $270 + $892.50 + $14,595 = $15,932.50
```
