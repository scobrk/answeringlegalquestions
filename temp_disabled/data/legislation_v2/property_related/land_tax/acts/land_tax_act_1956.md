### Market Value Assessment
Factors considered:

- Location and accessibility
- Planning restrictions

### Revaluation Cycle
- **Metropolitan areas:** Revalued every 3-4 years
- **Regional areas:** May have longer cycles
- **Annual adjustments:** Applied between formal revaluations

## Calculation Examples

### Example 1: Standard Residential Property
**Land Value:** $1,500,000
- Tax-free threshold: $969,000
- Taxable amount: $1,500,000 - $969,000 = $531,000
- Land tax: $531,000 × 1.6% = $8,496

### Example 2: High-Value Property
**Land Value:** $6,000,000
- Tier 1: ($4,488,000 - $969,000) × 1.6% = $56,304
- Tier 2: ($6,000,000 - $4,488,000) × 2.0% = $30,240
- Regular land tax: $56,304 + $30,240 = $86,544
- Premium property tax: $6,000,000 × 2.0% = $120,000
- **Total tax:** $86,544 + $120,000 = $206,544

### Example 3: Multiple Properties
**Property A:** $800,000 (principal residence - exempt)
**Property B:** $700,000 (investment property)
**Property C:** $600,000 (investment property)

- Combined value of taxable land: $1,300,000
- Tax-free threshold: $969,000
- Taxable amount: $331,000
- Land tax: $331,000 × 1.6% = $5,296
