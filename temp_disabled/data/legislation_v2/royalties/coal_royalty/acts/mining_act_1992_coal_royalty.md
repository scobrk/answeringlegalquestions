# Coal Royalty - Mining Act 1992

## Overview
Coal royalty is payable on coal extracted from NSW mining operations. The royalty is calculated based on the value of coal recovered and applies to all commercial coal mining activities in the state.

## Key Legislative Provisions

### Section 287 - Royalty Liability
**Royalty is payable by:**
- Holders of mining leases for coal
- Operators of coal mining activities
- Persons who extract coal from NSW lands

**Royalty applies to:**
- All coal extracted from mining leases
- Coal from assessment leases (during production)
- Coal recovered from rehabilitation activities

### Section 288 - Calculation of Royalty
**Royalty Rate:** Established by the Minister (currently set as of 1 July 2024)

**Calculation Base:**
- **Value of coal recovered:** Gross value less allowable deductions
- **Ex-mine value:** Value at point of extraction before transportation
- **Market value principles:** Applied where no arm's length sale

## Royalty Rate Structure (2024-25)

### Standard Coal Royalty Rates
The NSW Government has established a structured royalty rate system:

**Rate Determination:**
- Rates set annually by the Minister
- Based on coal type, quality, and market conditions
- Published in NSW Government Gazette

**Current Rate Framework:**
- **Thermal coal:** Rate varies by energy content and quality
- **Coking coal:** Rate varies by metallurgical properties
- **Export vs domestic:** Different rates may apply

### Value Thresholds
**High-value coal provisions:**
- Enhanced royalty rates for premium coal
- Based on international market prices
- Quarterly adjustments possible

## Coal Valuation Methods

### Arm's Length Sales
**Primary method when available:**
- Actual selling price to unrelated parties
- Must reflect true market value
- Adjustments for non-standard terms

### Market Value Determination
**When no arm's length sale:**
- Comparable sales analysis
- Industry benchmark pricing
- Professional valuation reports
- Published coal price indices

### Allowable Deductions
**From gross coal value:**
- Transport costs from mine to port/buyer
- Washing and preparation costs
- Handling and loading costs
- Quality adjustments and penalties

**Non-allowable deductions:**
- Corporate overhead costs
- Financing costs
- Profit margins
- Non-coal related expenses

## Types of Coal and Classification
