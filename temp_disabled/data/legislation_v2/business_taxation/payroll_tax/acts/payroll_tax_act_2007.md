# Payroll Tax Act 2007

## Overview
Payroll tax is imposed on employers who pay wages above the tax-free threshold. It applies to wages paid or payable to employees for services performed in NSW, or for services performed outside NSW by NSW residents.

## Key Legislative Provisions

### Section 5 - Liability to Tax
An employer is liable for payroll tax if:
- Wages paid or payable exceed the tax-free threshold ($1,200,000 annually)
- Employer has a connection to NSW
- Wages are paid for services in NSW or to NSW residents

### Section 6 - Taxable Wages
Taxable wages include:
- **Salary and wages:** All remuneration including overtime, bonuses, commissions
- **Allowances:** Travel, accommodation, tool allowances (unless exempt)
- **Benefits:** Non-cash benefits including fringe benefits
- **Superannuation:** Employer superannuation contributions above statutory minimums
- **Shares and options:** Value of shares/options provided to employees
- **Contractor payments:** Payments to certain contractors treated as wages

### Section 11 - Rate of Tax
**Current Rate (2024-25):** 5.45% of taxable wages above the tax-free threshold

### Section 15 - Tax-Free Threshold
**Annual Threshold:** $1,200,000 per financial year
**Monthly Threshold:** $100,000 per month

For employers with wages between the monthly and annual thresholds, a deduction applies:
**Monthly Deduction = (Annual Threshold - Annual Wages) ÷ 12**

## Grouping Provisions

### Section 25 - Grouped Employers
Employers are grouped when:
- One corporation controls another
- Related corporations under same control
- Trusts and companies under common control
- Partnerships with common partners

### Grouping Consequences
- Combined wages of all group members
- Single tax-free threshold for entire group
- Joint and several liability
- Shared lodgment obligations

### Common Control Scenarios
- **Direct control:** 50%+ shareholding
- **Indirect control:** Control through chain of companies
- **De facto control:** Ability to determine policy
- **Trust control:** Control over trust decisions

## Calculation Methods

### Basic Calculation
```
Monthly Tax = (Monthly Taxable Wages - Monthly Deduction) × 5.45%

Where Monthly Deduction = MAX(0, (1,200,000 - Annual Wages Estimate) ÷ 12)
```

### Annual Reconciliation
At year-end:
1. Calculate annual tax liability
2. Compare with monthly payments made
3. Pay shortfall or claim refund

### Example Calculations

**Example 1: Wages $1,500,000 annually**
- Annual wages: $1,500,000
- Tax-free threshold: $1,200,000
- Taxable amount: $300,000
- Annual tax: $300,000 × 5.45% = $16,350

**Example 2: Monthly fluctuations**
- July wages: $80,000 (below monthly threshold)
- August wages: $120,000 (above monthly threshold)
- Estimated annual wages: $1,100,000 (below annual threshold)
- Monthly deduction: ($1,200,000 - $1,100,000) ÷ 12 = $8,333
- August tax: ($120,000 - $8,333) × 5.45% = $6,086
